## __Project #1: Calculator Interface__


This project consisted of building the User Interface of a recognizable IOS Apple Calculator using what I'd learned from previous practice with IBActions and IBOutlets of Swift in x-code.

* This image shows how the interface looks on a functional Iphone 11 Pro Max(left) and the seperated layers that lead to the final product(right).


* Here, it can also be seen, but when the 11 is rotated to the right. This step took some formating reconfiguration, but worked out fine overall.
